metric:
  name: "Assessment Completion Rate"
  definition: "Percentage of users who start the 5-step wizard and receive a complete results dashboard"
  formula: "(Users who reach /results with rendered dashboard) / (Users who load /assess Step 1) * 100"
  target: "70%"

personas:
  primary:
    name: "Sarah Chen"
    role: "Fractional vCISO"
    goal: "Generate credible dollar-denominated risk estimates for clients in under 10 minutes"
    pain: "Manual Excel modeling is 2-3 hours per client; no affordable tool produces Monte Carlo distributions"
  secondary:
    name: "James Okonkwo"
    role: "SMB CFO/Founder"
    goal: "Get defensible cyber exposure dollar figure for board meeting"
    pain: "No security background; board expects financial language; needs answer this week"
  tertiary:
    name: "Rachel Torres"
    role: "Cyber Insurance Broker"
    goal: "Pre-qualify clients with quick exposure estimates before underwriting"
    pain: "Carrier questionnaires are 40-60 questions; no quick triage tool exists"

phases:
  - name: "Phase 1: Hackathon MVP"
    timeline: "Feb 21-25, 2026"
    success: "Working end-to-end flow: landing -> wizard -> API -> results dashboard, deployed on Vercel"
    kill_threshold: "If Monte Carlo API does not return valid results for 3+ industry/revenue combos by end of Day 2, stop features and fix the engine"

      - "Production URL on Vercel"
      - "Landing page screenshot (1280px+)"
      - "Explainer document"
      - "Working end-to-end assessment flow"
  - name: "Phase 2: Post-Hackathon Polish"
    timeline: "Feb 26 - Mar 31, 2026"
    success: "Scenario comparison, PDF/shareable URLs, mobile-responsive, comprehensive error handling"
    kill_threshold: "If PDF export takes >2 weeks, drop it and focus on shareable URLs"

      - "Scenario comparison mode"
      - "PDF or shareable URL"
      - "Mobile-responsive results"
      - "Comprehensive input validation"
  - name: "Phase 3: Growth"
    timeline: "Apr - Jun 2026"
