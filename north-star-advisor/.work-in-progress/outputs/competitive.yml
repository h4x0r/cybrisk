    note: "Most common competitor; most SMBs do not quantify cyber risk"

differentiators:
  unique:
    - "Gordon-Loeb optimal security spend calculation (no competitor offers this)"
    - "Built-in actuarial data from IBM/DBIR/NetDiligence (no user-sourced parameters)"
    - "Stateless, no-account, privacy-by-design architecture"
  strong:
    - "5-minute self-service with 10K Monte Carlo iterations"
    - "Free with no pricing tier"
    - "Transparent methodology with source attribution"
