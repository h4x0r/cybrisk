project:
  name: "CybRisk"
  description: "Cyber risk posture calculator that translates security controls into dollar-denominated financial exposure estimates using Monte Carlo simulation"
  version: "0.1.0"
  target_users: "vCISOs, fractional security advisors, SMB executives, cyber insurance buyers"
  core_problem: "Boards need cyber risk in dollars, not compliance checklists. No self-service tool provides Monte Carlo-simulated financial exposure."
  differentiator: "Real actuarial data (IBM/DBIR/NetDiligence) + FAIR model + Monte Carlo simulation = dollar-denominated risk, not qualitative scores"
  success_metric: "Working end-to-end flow deployed on Vercel, visually impressive for 2-minute hackathon demo"
  tech_stack: "Next.js 14+ App Router, Tailwind + Shadcn/ui, Recharts, TypeScript Monte Carlo engine, Vercel"

extract:
  axioms:
    - "Dollars > Scores: financial output always beats qualitative rating"
    - "Distribution > Point Estimate: never show just a mean, always show the range"
    - "Speed > Precision: useful estimate in 5 min beats perfect analysis in 5 days"
    - "Transparency > Polish: show methodology, sources, confidence intervals"
    - "Stateless > Persistent: no accounts, no storage, no tracking"
